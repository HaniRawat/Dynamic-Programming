Dynamic Programming
Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions related to Dynamic Programming. Dynamic Programming is a method used for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, storing the solutions of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. It's a fundamental technique widely applied in fields like competitive programming, resource allocation, and problem optimization.

I am using the Coder Army Sheet for these questions [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pud-vdSPhhljScynHvTUGRE5yxEV6dCMb45rOwoSt_Q/edit#gid=0).

Introduction
In this repository, you'll find solutions to a variety of Dynamic Programming DSA questions. Each solution is implemented in C++ (or any preferred programming language) and organized into separate directories based on the type of problem for easy navigation. Topics include classic DP problems such as Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, Fibonacci variations, and Pathfinding algorithms.
